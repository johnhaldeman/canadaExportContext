# Canada Export Context
An Application to Visualize Canadian Export Data
This site was created by John Haldeman in order to learn more about the following:

- The Nature of Canadian Trade
- Web Development with Angular 2 and differences with Angular 1.X
- The Angular Materials Library
- Web Development with Bootstrap 4 and differences with Bootstrap 3.X
- Data Visualization on the Web and the use of Google Charts
- Hosting projects on a cloud provider

The site also uses a Java based backend providing REST over HTTP services that query a PostgreSQL database.
