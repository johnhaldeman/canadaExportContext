      <h1>About Canadian Trade in Context</h1>

      <p> This site was created by John Haldeman in order to learn more about the
        following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Nature of Canadian Trade</li>
        <li>Web Development with Angular 2 and differences with Angular 1.X</li>
        <li>Web Development with Bootstrap 4 and differences with Bootstrap 3.X</li>
        <li>Data Visualization on the Web and the use of Google Charts</li>
        <li>Hosting projects on a cloud provider</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The site also uses a Java based backend providing REST over HTTP services
        that query a PostgreSQL database. </p>

      <h2> Where is the Data From? </h2>
      <p>The data was retrieved from Canada's open data portal. In particular the
        "Canadian International Merchandise Trade Database" data sets located
        <a href="http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/6f3fd3d9-5a35-47a8-a45a-4b2a8c957453">
          here</a>. While I have endeavored to show data that is correct, I make no
          claims on accuracy or validity. </p>

      <h2> Some of the Links Don't Work? </h2>
      <p> This site is currently under construction. While the "Products" area is
      more or less complete, other sections are still being built. Check back for
      updates and new visualizations. </p>
